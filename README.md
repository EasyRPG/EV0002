EV0002
======

The channel bot in #easyrpg on freenode, provides logs and pizza (and maybe more).

It is using the [cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch) bot framework and is
written in ruby, like the legacy EV0001.

Needed gems beside `cinch` are: `json`, see Gemfile for details.
You can use bundler to install the dependencies.
